Basically this project is to manipulate audio files of type
"*.wav".

With this tool we can load "*.wav" files. After that you can
do some changes like:	-make it play faster/slower.
			-invers the audio
			-change the number of channels
			-save the modified file in a new file
			-even to cut the file in many pieces
			-...

Also we have made some basic sounds to show that we are able to create a manual wav file from scratch with a sound inside.

As well you can use our program with some basic flags
-l "name of file" (load)
-load "name of file"
-s "name of file" (save)
-save "name of file"
-i void (info of wav header)
-info void same as -i
-r void (reversing the audio)
-reverse void same as -r
-mono void (mono transformation)
-stereo void (stereo transformation)
-6 void(6 canaux transformation)
-scale "value" (changing the speed of playing the audio)

Any bugs, reports or sugestions you can send at seinic1994@gmail.com
